""" Inheritance or Composition
- Both attempt to solve the problem of reusable code.
- Inheritance solves this problem by creating a machanism for you to have implied 
	features in base classes
- Composition solves this problem by giving you modules and the ability to call
	call functions in other classes.
	
1. Avoid multiple inheritance at all costs, as it's too complex to be reliable. If 
	 you're stuck with it, then be prepared to know thee class hierarchy and spend time 
	 finding where everything is coming from.
2. Use composition to package code into modules that are used in many different 
	 unrelated places and situations.
3. Use inheritance only when there are clearly related reusable pieces of code that 
   fit under a single common concept or if you have to because of something you're using.
